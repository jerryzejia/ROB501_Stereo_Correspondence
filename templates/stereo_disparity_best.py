    """
    Best stereo correspondence algorithm.

    This function computes a stereo disparity image from left stereo 
    image Il and right stereo image Ir. Only disparity values within
    the bounding box region are evaluated.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    Il    - Left stereo image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    Ir    - Right stereo image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    bbox  - 2x2 np.array, bounding box, relative to left image, from top left
            corner to bottom right corner (inclusive).
    maxd  - Integer, maximum disparity value; disparities must be within zero
            to maxd inclusive (i.e., don't search beyond rng)

    Returns:
    --------
    Id  - Disparity image (map) as np.array, same size as Il, greyscale.

    # Hints:
    #
    #  - Loop over each image row, computing the local similarity measure, then
    #    aggregate. At the border, you may replicate edge pixels, or just avoid
    #    using values outside of the image.
    #
    #  - You may hard-code any parameters you require in this function.
    #
    #  - Use whatever window size you think might be suitable.
    #
    #  - Don't optimize for runtime (too much), optimize for clarity.
